## How It Works

The Appfolio Snowflake project works by leveraging the Appfolio API to extract data and load it into Snowflake. The process involves the following steps:

1. **Data Extraction**: The project connects to the Appfolio API using the provided API key and retrieves the necessary data.
2. **Data Transformation**: The extracted data is transformed into a format suitable for loading into Snowflake. This may involve data cleaning, normalization, and other transformation operations.
3. **Data Loading**: The transformed data is loaded into Snowflake using the provided Snowflake credentials. The data is stored in the specified database, schema, and warehouse.
4. **Real-time Updates**: The project supports real-time data updates, ensuring that the data in Snowflake is always up-to-date with the latest information from Appfolio.
5. **Logging and Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and error handling mechanisms are in place to ensure smooth operation and easy troubleshooting.

## Configurable Components

The project includes several configurable components that can be customized to suit your needs:

1. **Appfolio API Configuration**: The `config/config.json` file contains the configuration for connecting to the Appfolio API. You can update this file with your Appfolio API key and other relevant settings.
2. **Snowflake Configuration**: The `.env` file contains environment variables for connecting to Snowflake. You can update this file with your Snowflake account details, user credentials, database, schema, and warehouse information.
3. **Data Transformation Rules**: The data transformation rules can be customized in the `src/services` directory. You can modify the existing transformation logic or add new rules to meet your specific requirements.
4. **Logging Configuration**: The logging configuration can be adjusted in the `src/config` directory. You can customize the logging level, format, and destination to suit your needs.
5. **Error Handling**: The error handling mechanisms can be customized in the `src/controllers` directory. You can modify the existing error handling logic or add new handlers to address specific error scenarios.
